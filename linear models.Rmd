```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2) %>% 
  rename(
    borough = neighbourhood_group,
    neighborhood = neighbourhood) %>% 
  filter(borough != "Staten Island") %>% 
  select(price, stars, borough, neighborhood, room_type)
```


Visualizations

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=stars, y=price)) + geom_point()
```

Let's fit a linear model...

```{r}
fit = lm(price ~ stars + borough, data = nyc_airbnb)

fit
```
